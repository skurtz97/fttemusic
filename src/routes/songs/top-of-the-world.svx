Vincent Monument, a man so tense,  
Escaped the face of common sense,  
He’s living free in the land of Texas,  
He gambles around like a nervous breakdown.  

What if you could ease the demand?  
Surely you’d extend your hand.  
If I could lend you my hand, I would  
Lift you up till you understand.  

I’d like to be at the top of the world.  
I’d like to be at the top of the world with you.  

The think tanks of the Valley rumble, and  
Lay you flat with gravity. Well,  
That’s the way the cookies crumble,  
When you fill that cavity.  

Suppose you could give your speech,  
And everybody on the planet reach,  
Can every trauma really be erased?  
The greatest moment we ever faced.  

I’d like to be at the top of the world.  
I’d like to be at the top of the world with you.  
Top of the world to you, top of the world to you  
Top of the world to me and you.  

Vincent Monument, head of the class,  
The future lies within your grasp,  
All hands sculpted fists of stone,  
Vincent Monument, where did I go?  

So what if I feel sad?  
It doesn’t have to be so bad.  
I don’t have to take the blame no more,  
When it’s true, what I’m aiming for.  

I’d like to be at the top of the world.  
I’d like to be at the top of the world with you.  
Top of the world to you  
Top of the world to me and you.
