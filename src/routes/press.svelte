      <b>From Analogue Trash blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Chinese Underground sees Kurtz examine authoritarianism in his trademark wry style. . . .
        Chinese Underground has an air of the 80s about it, with Kurtz‚Äôs vocals in particular
        echoing the plaintive yet melodic tones of XTC‚Äôs Andy Partridge. Zappa and Talking Heads
        influence can be heard in the brisk, angular, and expansive influences of the arrangement.

    <p>
      <b>From Columna Musical blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Rich sonic layers and clear Zappa influences, especially creative use of Chinese
        instruments adding unique colors to the tune. Noteworthy lyrics as well.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>From Phonograph Me blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Well-crafted, lively and vibrant, with energetic instrumentation and dynamic harmonies,
        quite fond of the intricate textures . . Everything sounds so effortless.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>From Obscure Sound blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Fondly reminding me of Talking Heads and XTC with the confidently melodic vocals and
        playful lyrics. Enjoyed the sophisti-pop added vocal . . ."Plenty of room in the training
        camp," playing well amidst the Chinese marimba . . . Enjoyed the creative sound overall.

      <i>The ambition and invention of the track are fantastic, making for an engaging mood. </i>

      <b>From The Slow Music Movement blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Cool, catchy piece of pop music with a pleasingly subversive, Talking Heads sort of vibe -
        lots of good going on here.

    <h4>Feedback about our summer 2022 psychedelic hit, ‚ÄúROBOT ODDiTY‚Äù</h4>
    <p>
      <b>From UNXIGNED blogsite -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Curious, lush, and inventive vibe here. The track blends lo-fi rock and psychedelic pop
        textures that make for a classic-flavored, contemplative, and grounded character that‚Äôs easy
        to jam along to. Recalls the likes of The Beatles, The Shins, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, etc.
        Clearly the style combines these genres. Appreciate the spacious feel as well as the suiting
        vocal work.

      <b>From Alpas Records -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Indeed a pretty original song, the layered melodies are quite pleasing to listen to . . .
        Pleasing feel . . . pronounced keys and percussive elements. A bit of Frank Zappa and a slow
        paced Abba mixed with some jazzy instrumentals.

    <p>
      <b>From Music On The Moon (Spotify playlister) -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >Unique sound. Cool synth sounds. Avant-garde arrangement and melody lines. Quirky. Strong
        vocals. Quick flowing arrangement. Plenty of push and pull to the energy. Imaginative
        lyricism that paints an immersive world. Well crafted.

        strong and pleasing to the ear. This is a very high quality and beautifully crafted song.

      <b>From our press release package -‚Äì</b>
      <i
        >A cerulean blue android spins his regretful victory song on a keyboard odyssey from a
        bric-a-brac robot factory to a sunny, magic beach town finale, while riding sonic waves of
        piano, synth and brassy percussion shuffles. ROBOT ODDiTY is the upcoming spring 2022 Modern
        soft rock track from Friends To The End. The accompanying edgy music video with a
        psychedelic twist paints the tale of indoctrination and moral discovery by Thom Kurtz, the
        creator behind his Friends To The End band project, with a near-death experience in a raging
        fire at a power plant, while living as ‚Äúwires inside an iron can.‚Äù

        This video is life-changing. The amazing SFX, the incredible OST, and the best part has to
        be the storyline and moral. There is such amazing lore to this short-film, and the video all
        together is terrific. 10/10 for me, one of the best videos ever created for sure.

        and others. The assortment of pictures and short videos peak my interest where you displayed
        a variety of themes. Lyrics were light (not deep thinking) and fun. Once again I enjoyed the
