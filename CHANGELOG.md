- [x] About page - please review all the text carefully for missing bold, e.g. in par.4, it's missing on "Friends To The End music channel."
- [x] About page - add a new paragraph in par.5 after the first sentence (see the original About page for reference).
- [x] Songs page - reformat the header image so it's centered bottom, so we can see the street (it's Old Pecan Street, you see.)
- [ ] Individual songs pages - make the parenthetical sub-headers the same font as the lyrics
- [ ] Individual songs pages - left-justify all the lyrics
- [ ] Individual songs pages - missing headline text on LOTR, AWOT, ASAYSIJ and WYPTB.
